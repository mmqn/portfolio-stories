# Architype

Architype was one of the most extensive support projects during my time in architecture, and it was certainly one of my favorite design projects thus far.

Here's the premise: We had to look at architectural works from a well-known architect to develop a new typeface and abstract three-dimensional object inspired by said architect's works. Basically, one medium of expression (architecture) would be morphed into two others.

The architect I was given was _Mies van der Rohe_, a mid-century German-American architect responsible for leading a modernist design movement best encapsulated by his phrase _"Less is more"_.

The first step was to analyze the architect's life and work in a 3x4 grid presentation. This allowed me to understand the theme of Mies' work and what was most important to carry over into my typeface and object.

I went through several iterations inspired by some of Mies' most iconic work.

I decided that his Barcelona Pavilion would be the best foundation on which I should design my work. It had the most flexibility in allowing me to design legible latin characters.

The final step of the project was the most interesting. The Barcelona Pavilion had already been abstracted once, and here, it will be abstracted even more.

In architecture, it's important to understand physical elements at their most granular level, and deconstructing elements to build new ones helps us understand them.

Each letter in my original typeface was extruded into a three-dimensional shape. It was up to me to experiment with how these shapes should be combined into an object that should, first and foremost, be aesthetically pleasing, while still carrying the _essence_ of Mies' work.

The red-filled shapes of my typeface were the elements I used to construct the final "Pavilion" object. The exploded view gives a glimpse into the conversion process.
