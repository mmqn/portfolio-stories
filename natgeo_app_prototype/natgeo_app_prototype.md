This personal project served as a sort of testing ground for me to experiment with _Adobe XD_ for the first time. Also considering that I usually work in a desktop context, both when designing and developing, I also got to experiment with mobile UX.

Needless to say, this project is far from perfect, but I think it does present some interesting ideas in motion design and content layout.

I wanted the app to pay homage to National Geographic's magazines. It's meant to fuse the experience of reading a physical magazine with using a mobile app.

There's also a lot of visual references to the iconic hollow golden rectangle throughout the app. The sidebar in the articles and photos pages replicates a single side of the rectangle. When you open an article, the golden bar is anchored and shifts from right to left to reveal the story.

This golden bar serves as a stable and subtle cue informing the user which view they are in at all times. It also presents the idea that this is a singular app with interconnected pages, as opposed to an app with disparate and deeply nested pages.

Another central idea to the app design is that there should be no wasted screen real estate. That's not to say negative space is unwelcome, but that unnecessary spaces like the side margins of photos are avoided.

Notice how the images in the article page view fills up all horizontal space. This helps make the interface feel more immersive and clean in a mobile context.

On the other hand, margins are used in places where it's necessary to show separation.

The typeface, Avenir, ties it all together to communicate the feeling that this app is classy—like classic Nat Geo magazines—and modern—reflecting its app/technology aspect.
